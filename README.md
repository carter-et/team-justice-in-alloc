# Project Alek

App for allocating resources when there is limited supply.

## Getting Started

After cloning the project, open 'team-justice-in-alloc' in Android Studio. It should install 
virtual phones for you. If you don't have Flutter and Dart plugins already, you can add those by
going to File > Settings > Plugins and adding Flutter. It will automatically add Dart at this point.

For a missing AVD install, check [here](https://abhiandroid.com/androidstudio/create-avd-virtual-device-emulator-android-studio)

If you are running an AMD CPU, your virtualization may be turned OFF by default. 
To turn it on, check [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/virtualization/sect-virtualization-troubleshooting-enabling_intel_vt_and_amd_v_virtualization_hardware_extensions_in_bios)

Once all the plugins are installed and you have an AVD setup, you should be able to build the
project.
